# Substrate Cumulus Parachain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/)-based Substrate node, ready for hacking :cloud:

This project is a fork of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to an established **relay chain**.

👉 Learn more about parachains [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parachains), and
parathreads [here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-parathreads).

## Build & Run

Follow these steps to prepare a local Substrate development environment :hammer_and_wrench:

### Setup of Machine

If necessary, refer to the setup instructions at the
[Substrate Developer Hub](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/#manual-installation).

### Build

Once the development environment is set up, build the Cumulus Parachain Template. This command will
build the
[Wasm Runtime](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#wasm-execution) and
[native](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/executor#native-execution) code:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Relay Chain

> **NOTE**: In the following two sections, we document how to manually start a few relay chain
> nodes, start a parachain node (collator), and register the parachain with the relay chain.
>
> We also have the [**`polkadot-launch`**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polkadot-launch) CLI tool
> that automate the following steps and help you easily launch relay chains and parachains. However
> it is still good to go through the following procedures once to understand the mechanism for running
> and registering a parachain.

To operate a parathread or parachain, you _must_ connect to a relay chain. Typically you would test
on a local Rococo development network, then move to the testnet, and finally launch on the mainnet.
**Keep in mind you need to configure the specific relay chain you will connect to in your collator
`chain_spec.rs`**. In the following examples, we will use `rococo-local` as the relay network.

### Build Relay Chain

Clone and build [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) (beware of the version tag we used):

```bash
# Get a fresh clone, or `cd` to where you have polkadot already:
git clone -b v0.9.7 --depth 1 https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot.git
cd polkadot
cargo build --release
```

### Generate the Relay Chain Chainspec

First, we create the chain specification file (chainspec). Note the chainspec file _must_ be generated on a
_single node_ and then shared among all nodes!

👉 Learn more about chain specification [here](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/chain-spec).

```bash
./target/release/polkadot build-spec \
--chain rococo-local \
--raw \
--disable-default-bootnode \
> rococo_local.json
```

### Start Relay Chain

We need *n + 1* full _validator_ nodes running on a relay chain to accept *n* parachain / parathread
connections. Here we will start two relay chain nodes so we can have one parachain node connecting in
later.

From the Polkadot working directory:

```bash
# Start Relay `Alice` node
./target/release/polkadot \
--chain ./rococo_local.json \
-d /tmp/relay/alice \
--validator \
--alice \
--port 50555
```

Open a new terminal, same directory:

```bash
# Start Relay `Bob` node
./target/release/polkadot \
--chain ./rococo_local.json \
-d /tmp/relay/bob \
--validator \
--bob \
--port 50556
```

Add more nodes as needed, with non-conflicting ports, DB directories, and validator keys
(`--charlie`, `--dave`, etc.).

### Reserve a ParaID

To connect to a relay chain, you must first _reserve a `ParaId` for your parathread that will
become a parachain. To do this, you will need sufficient amount of currency on the network account
to reserve the ID.

In this example, we will use **`Charlie` development account** where we have funds available.
Once you submit this extrinsic successfully, you can start your collators.

The easiest way to reserve your `ParaId` is via
[Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/parachains/parathreads)
under the `Parachains` -> `Parathreads` tab and use the `+ ParaID` button.

## Parachain

### Select the Correct Relay Chain

To operate your parachain, you need to specify the correct relay chain you will connect to in your
collator `chain_spec.rs`. Specifically you pass the command for the network you need in the
`Extensions` of your `ChainSpec::from_genesis()` [in the code](node/src/chain_spec.rs#78-81).

```rust
Extensions {
	relay_chain: "rococo-local".into(), // You MUST set this to the correct network!
	para_id: id.into(),
},
```

> You can choose from any pre-set runtime chainspec in the Polkadot repo, by referring to the
> `cli/src/command.rs` and `node/service/src/chain_spec.rs` files or generate your own and use
> that. See the [Cumulus Workshop](https://substrate.dev/cumulus-workshop/) for how.

In the following examples, we will use the `rococo-local` relay network we setup in the last section.

### Export the Parachain Genesis and Runtime

We first generate the **genesis state** and **genesis wasm** needed for the parachain registration.

```bash
# Build the parachain node (from it's top level dir)
cd substrate-parachain-template
cargo build --release

# Folder to store resource files needed for parachain registration
mkdir -p resources

# Build the chainspec
./target/release/parachain-collator build-spec \
--disable-default-bootnode > ./resources/template-local-plain.json

# Build the raw chainspec file
./target/release/parachain-collator build-spec \
--chain=./resources/template-local-plain.json \
--raw --disable-default-bootnode > ./resources/template-local-raw.json

# Export genesis state to `./resources`, using 2000 as the ParaId
./target/release/parachain-collator export-genesis-state --parachain-id 2000 > ./resources/para-2000-genesis

# Export the genesis wasm
./target/release/parachain-collator export-genesis-wasm > ./resources/para-2000-wasm
```

> **NOTE**: we have set the `para_ID` to be **2000** here. This _must_ be unique for all parathreads/chains
> on the relay chain you register with. You _must_ reserve this first on the relay chain for the
> testnet or mainnet.

### Start a Parachain Node (Collator)

From the parachain template working directory:

```bash
# NOTE: this command assumes the chain spec is in a directory named `polkadot`
# that is at the same level of the template working directory. Change as needed.
#
# It also assumes a ParaId of 2000. Change as needed.
./target/release/parachain-collator \
-d /tmp/parachain/alice \
--collator \
--alice \
--force-authoring \
--ws-port 9945 \
--parachain-id 2000 \
-- \
--execution wasm \
--chain ../polkadot/rococo_local.json
```

_Output:_

You see messages are from both a relaychain node and a parachain node. This is because a relay chain
light client is also run next to the parachain collator.

### Parachain Registration

Now that you have two relay chain nodes, and a parachain node accompanied with a relay chain light
client running, the next step is to register the parachain in the relay chain with the following
steps (for detail, refer to the [Substrate Cumulus Worship](https://substrate.dev/cumulus-workshop/#/en/3-parachains/2-register)):

- Goto [Polkadot Apps UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer), connecting to your relay chain.

- Execute a sudo extrinsic on the relay chain by going to `Developer` -> `sudo` page.

- Pick `paraSudoWrapper` -> `sudoScheduleParaInitialize(id, genesis)` as the extrinsic type,
shown below.

	![Polkadot Apps UI](docs/assets/ss01.png)

- Set the `id: ParaId` to 2,000 (or whatever ParaId you used above), and set the `parachain: Bool`
option to **Yes**.

- For the `genesisHead`, drag the genesis state file exported above, `para-2000-genesis`, in.

- For the `validationCode`, drag the genesis wasm file exported above, `para-2000-wasm`, in.

> **Note**: When registering to the public Rococo testnet, ensure you set a **unique** `paraId`
> larger than 1,000. Values below 1,000 are reserved _exclusively_ for system parachains.

### Restart the Parachain (Collator)

The collator node may need to be restarted to get it functioning as expected. After a
[new epoch](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/glossary#epoch) starts on the relay chain,
your parachain will come online. Once this happens, you should see the collator start
reporting _parachain_ blocks:

```bash
# Notice the relay epoch change! Only then do we start parachain collating!

**Note the delay here!** It may take some time for your relay chain to enter a new epoch.

## Rococo & Westend Relay Chain Testnets

_Is this Cumulus Parachain Template Rococo & Westend testnets compatible?_ **Yes!**

- **Rococo** is the testnet of Kusama (join the
[Rococo Faucet](https://matrix.to/#/#rococo-faucet:matrix.org) to get testing funds).
- **Westend** is the testnet of Polkadot (join the
[Westend Faucet](https://matrix.to/#/#westend_faucet:matrix.org) to get testing funds).

See the [Cumulus Workshop](https://substrate.dev/cumulus-workshop/) for the latest instructions to
register a parathread/parachain on a relay chain.

> **NOTE**: When running the relay chain and parachain, you _must_ use the _same_ tagged version of
> [Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot) and [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus)
> so the collator would register successfully to the relay chain.
> You should test locally registering your parachain successfully before attempting to connect to
> any running relay chain network!

Find `chainspec` files to connect to live networks [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/master/node/service/res).
You want to be sure to use the correct git release tag in these files, as they change from time
to time and _must_ match the live network!

These networks are under _constant development_ - so please follow the progress and update of
your parachains in lock step with the testnet changes if you wish to connect to the network. Do
join the [Parachain Technical matrix chat room](https://app.element.io/#/room/#parachain-technical:matrix.parity.io)
to ask questions and connect with the parachain building teams.
