# Ideally, we could just do something like `COPY . .`, but that doesn't work:
# it busts the cache every time non-source files like inject_bootnodes.sh change,
# as well as when non-`.dockerignore`'d transient files (*.log and friends)
# show up. There is no way to exclude particular files, or write a negative
# rule, using Docker's COPY syntax, which derives from go's filepath.Match rules.
#
# We can't combine these into a single big COPY operation like
# `COPY collator consensus network runtime test Cargo.* .`, because in that case
# docker will copy the _contents_ of each directory into the image workdir,
# not the actual directory. We're stuck just enumerating them.

# the collator stage is normally built once, cached, and then ignored, but can

# image, which is required for a launcher script. The script simply adds two
# arguments to the list passed in:
#
#   --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/PEER_ID
#
# with the appropriate ip and ID for both Alice and Bob
