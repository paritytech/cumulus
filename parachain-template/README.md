# Substrate Parachain Template

A new [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/)-based Parachain node, ready for hacking ðŸš€


The stand-alone version of this template is hosted on the [Substrate Devhub Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/) for each release of Polkadot.
This is generated directly at each `polkadot-vX.X.X` release branch from the [Parachain Template in Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachain-template) upstream.

It is usually best to to use the stand-alone version to start a new project.
All bugs, suggestions, and feature requests should be made upstream to [Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/tree/master/parachain-template).
