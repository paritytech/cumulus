//! # Bridge Transfer Pallet
//!
//! Module supports transfer assets over bridges between different consensus chain.
//! With fine-grained configuration you can control transferred assets (out/in) between different consensus chain.
//! "Transfer asset over bridge" recognize two kinds of transfer see `types::AssetTransferKind`.

// Ensure we're `no_std` when compiling for Wasm.
