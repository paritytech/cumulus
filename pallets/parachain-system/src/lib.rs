//! cumulus-pallet-parachain-system is a base pallet for cumulus-based parachains.
//!
//! This pallet handles low-level details of being a parachain. It's responsibilities include:
//!
//! - ingestion of the parachain validation data
//! - ingestion of incoming downward and lateral messages and dispatching them
//! - coordinating upgrades with the relay-chain
//! - communication of parachain outputs, such as sent messages, signalling an upgrade, etc.
//!
//! Users must ensure that they register this pallet as an inherent provider.
